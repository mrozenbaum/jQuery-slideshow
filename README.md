JQuery Slideshow

For this assignment you must use JQuery to make a slideshow.

Slideshows should have the following features:

Arrow buttons to navigate between images
An auto-rotate feature that navigates through the images on a loop
A caption for each image
A fade in and fade out animation.
A consistent height and width, regardless of the size or dimensions of the images being shown.
Bonus

Use JQuery AJAX to get your images from an external API. Try NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day API or find your own.
Allow the user to change the animation from fade in/out to slide in/out.
Have captions only appear on hover.
